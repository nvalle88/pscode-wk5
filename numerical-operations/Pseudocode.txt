Bubble sort.
1.Read the number of numbers to evaluate, "n".
2.Iterate from 0 to "n" for the number of inputs in step 1.
	2.1 Verify if it is an integer.
	2.2 If it is an integer, add it to a list.
	2.3 If it is not an integer, try again and repeat step 2.1.
3.Calculate the average: Sum all numbers in the list and divide by the number of elements in the list.
4.Sort using the bubble sort method.
	4.0 Outer loop: Iterate through all elements of the list from 0 to n.
	4.1 Inner loop: Iterate through the list from j=0 to the number of elements in the list "n" minus the current outer loop cycle number "i" minus one.
		4.1.1 Compare the current element with the next element in the list.
		4.1.2 If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them.
	4.3 Perform step 4.1 until the end of the list.
	4.4 Repeat step 4.0 until the end of the list.

5.Minimum: Take the first element of the list.
6.Maximum: Take the last element of the list.
