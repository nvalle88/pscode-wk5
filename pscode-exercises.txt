// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

1.Read number 1.
2.Verify if the number read is a number.
3.Read number 2.
4.Verify if the number read is a number.
5.Sum number 1 and number 2.
6.Print the result.


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

1.Read the number.
2.Verify if the number is an integer.
3.The number is even if the remainder when divided by two is zero; if not, it is odd.
4.Print the result

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Bubble sort.
n=5;
1.Read the number of numbers to evaluate, "n".
2.Iterate from 0 to "n" for the number of inputs in step 1.
	2.1 Verify if it is an integer.
	2.2 If it is an integer, add it to a list.
	2.3 If it is not an integer, try again and repeat step 2.1.
3.Calculate the average: Sum all numbers in the list and divide by the number of elements in the list.
4.Sort using the bubble sort method.
	4.0 Outer loop: Iterate through all elements of the list from 0 to n.
	4.1 Inner loop: Iterate through the list from j=0 to the number of elements in the list "n" minus the current outer loop cycle number "i" minus one.
		4.1.1 Compare the current element with the next element in the list.
		4.1.2 If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them.
	4.3 Perform step 4.1 until the end of the list.
	4.4 Repeat step 4.0 until the end of the list.

5.Minimum: Take the first element of the list.
6.Maximum: Take the last element of the list.
